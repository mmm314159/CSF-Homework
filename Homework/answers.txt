Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

Sample 1
GC-content: 0.43029262963
Sample 2
GC-content: 0.451051333333
Sample 3
GC-content: 0.646864112524
Sample 4
GC-content: 0.347852341166
Sample 5
GC-content: 0.263157894737
Sample 6 
GC-content: 0.491518518519

Problem 3:

Commenting out the variable linenum throws a name error, on line 43,
the variable linenum is called and incremented. We commented out it's 
initialization, so when the program attempted to call the variable in order
to increment it, it was not defined, therefore doesn't exist.
Seq is the sequence variable as an open string that lists all the nucleotides
that have been processed so far.

Commenting out gc_count = 0 does the same thing as commenting out linenum; it
is called as a variable, and since we commented it out, it was never initialized
and therefore cannot be called.

Problem 4:

GC_content: 0.3
AT_content: 0.7

Collaboration:

I examined the file Cameron Casey had uploaded into git, he has helped me
understand previous homework. After examining his code, I found it easier
just to write my own. However, having his available as a complete, functioning
copy let me backwards engineer some of the parts I had a little trouble with.
I will likely take this approach again in the future, as backwards engineering
really helps me understand key ideas.

Reflection:

I enjoyed this assignment because it provided context that is relevant to the
real world. Actually writing a program (however small) that is similar in 
intent to some of the most complicated coding and scientific discoveries of 
my lifetime was really cool. And I'm a total genetics geek.
